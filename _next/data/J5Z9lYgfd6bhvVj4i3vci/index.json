In the proposed model, an EMG signal variance value is first generated from a probability distribution with a shape determined by a commanded muscle force and signal-dependent noise. Artificial EMG signals are then generated from the associated Gaussian distribution with a zero mean and the generated variance. This facilitates representation of artificial EMG signals with signal-dependent noise superimposed according to the muscle activation levels. The frequency characteristics of the EMG signals are also simulated via a shaping filter with parameters determined by an autoregressive model. An estimation method to determine EMG variance distribution using rectified and smoothed EMG signals, thereby allowing model parameter estimation with a small number of samples, is also incorporated in the proposed model. Moreover, the prediction of variance distribution with strong muscle contraction from EMG signals with low muscle contraction and related artificial EMG generation are also described. The results of experiments conducted, in which the reproduction capability of the proposed model was evaluated through comparison with measured EMG signals in terms of amplitude, frequency content, and EMG distribution demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce the features of measured EMG signals. Further, utilizing the generated EMG signals as training data for a neural network resulted in the classification of upper limb motion with a higher precision than by learning from only measured EMG signals. This indicates that the proposed model is also applicable to motion classification."},{"title":"An EMG pattern classification method based on a mixture of variance distribution models","authors":["Akira Furui","Hideaki Hayashi","Toshio Tsuji"],"venue":"Proceedings of 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC2018)","venueShort":"EMBC","year":2018,"pages":"5216--5219","pdfUrl":"","codeUrl":"","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513446","tags":["EMG","Probabilistic Model","Motion Recognition"],"type":"international","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1wbG1uBFMkckNMouY-NE276_Ui2cX56kg&sz=w2048","abstract":"This paper proposes an electromyogram (EMG) pattern classification method based on a mixture of variance distribution models.

This is done to allow patients to regain functionality of their lost hands. Myoelectric prosthetic hands were found to have the possibility of implementing intuitive controls based on operator’s electromyogram (EMG) signals. These controls have been extensively studied and developed. In recent years, development costs and maintainability of prosthetic hands have been improved through 3D printing technology. However, no previous studies have realized the advantages of EMG-based classification of multiple finger movements in conjunction with the introduction of advanced control mechanisms based on human motion.

The muscle synergy-based motion determination method and biomimetic impedance control are introduced in the proposed system, enabling the classification of unlearned combined motions and smooth and intuitive finger movements of the prosthetic hand. We evaluate the proposed system through operational experiments performed on six healthy participants and an upper-limb amputee participant.

Methods: This article describes the formulation of a stochastic EEG model based on a multivariate scale mixture distribution that can represent changes in non-Gaussianity caused by stochastic fluctuations in EEG.

A total of 26 movement features were calculated from video-recorded bodily movements of infants at 4 months of age. Their risk of ASD was assessed at 18 months of age with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlerhood, a widely used screening questionnaire. Infants at high risk for ASD at 18 months of age exhibited less rhythmic and weaker bodily movement patterns at 4 months of age than low-risk infants. When the observed bodily movement patterns were submitted to a machine learning-based analysis, linear and non-linear classifiers successfully predicted ASD-like behavior at 18 months of age based on the bodily movement patterns at 4 months of age, at the level acceptable for practical use. This study analyzed the relationship between spontaneous bodily movements at 4 months of age and the ASD risk at 18 months of age.

We evaluate the performance of various discriminative and generative classifiers on four EMG datasets, both visually and quantitatively. The analysis results show that while a discriminative classifier based on a deep neural network exhibits high accuracy, it outputs a confidence that differs from true probabilities. By contrast, a scale mixture model-based classifier, which is a generative classifier that can account for uncertainty in EMG variance, exhibits superior performance in terms of both accuracy and confidence."},{"title":"Mixupを利用した筋電位信号の擬似データ生成と複合動作の識別","authors":["矢沢 樹","古居 彬"],"venue":"第24回計測自動制御学会システムインテグレーション部門講演会（SI2023）","venueShort":"SI","year":2023,"month":12,"pages":"363-368","pdfUrl":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cX6Pg7jFCljllDY1RlUnI3Yl9YahSZY1/view?usp=sharing","tags":["EMG","Machine Learning","Motion Recognition","Data Generation"],"type":"domestic","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1I9aZNR6RK0DvsM7LlgEJgie7KYbW07DN&sz=w2048","abstract":"筋電位信号を用いた動作識別では，識別対象の全ての動作について訓練用データを収集する必要がある．しかし，実用上重要な多自由度の複合動作に関して，その全てをユーザから網羅的に計測することは非現実的である．本稿では，データ拡張手法であるMixupを利用した擬似データ生成により，複合動作を効率的に識別可能な手法を提案する．提案法では，基本動作時の計測信号と，その凸結合によって擬似的に生成された複合動作時の信号を識別器の訓練用データとして用いる．これにより，訓練用の計測動作数を抑えつつ，多様な複合動作を識別することが可能となる．実験では，健常成人から得られた筋電位信号を用いて提案法の有効性を検証した．"},{"title":"Bayesian Approach for Adaptive EMG Pattern Classification via Semi-supervised Sequential Learning","authors":["Seitaro Yoneda","Akira Furui"],"venue":"Proceedings of 2023 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)","venueShort":"SMC","year":2023,"pages":"3310-3315","pdfUrl":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oV797VEcID4kGB3W_bw_GBQzg-KIQsI7/view?usp=sharing","codeUrl":"https://github.com/example/vision-survey","doi":"10.1109/SMC53992.2023.10394290","tags":["EMG","Bayesian Model","Machine Learning","Motion Recognition"],"type":"international","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1uAee2TeWZW83gupMBi2oWXTE7ILAMXXJ&sz=w2048","abstract":"Intuitive human-machine interfaces may be developed using pattern classification to estimate executed human motions from electromyogram (EMG) signals generated during muscle contraction. The continual use of EMG-based interfaces gradually alters signal characteristics owing to electrode shift and muscle fatigue, leading to a gradual decline in classification accuracy. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for adaptive EMG pattern classification using semi-supervised sequential learning. The proposed method uses a Bayesian classification model based on Gaussian distributions to predict the motion class and estimate its confidence. Pseudo-labels are subsequently assigned to data with high-prediction confidence, and the posterior distributions of the model are sequentially updated within the framework of Bayesian updating, thereby achieving adaptive motion recognition to alterations in signal characteristics over time. Experimental results on six healthy adults demonstrated that the proposed method can suppress the degradation of classification accuracy over time and outperforms conventional methods. These findings demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and its applicability to practical EMG-based control systems."},{"title":"CNN-LSTMとプラーク表面情報を用いた超音波動画像中のJellyfish Sign自動識別","authors":["吉冨 孟志","久米 伸治","相澤 宏旭","古居 彬"],"venue":"第62回日本生体医工学会大会","year":2023,"month":5,"pages":"P1-24, p. 272","pdfUrl":"","tags":["Medical Image/Video","Ultrasound Imaging","Deep Learning","Time-series Analysis"],"type":"domestic","coverImage":null,"abstract":"【目的】頸動脈超音波検査により，非侵襲かつリアルタイムにプラーク病変の動的性状を評価できる．近年，血流の拍動によってプラーク表面が浮き沈みするJellyfish signという特徴が注目されており，この特徴を呈した症例の多くが脳梗塞を発症したと報告されていることから，Jellyfish signを早期に発見できれば有用である．そこで本稿では，動画像解析と深層学習を用いてJellyfish signを自動識別可能な手法を提案する．【方法】提案法では，まず計測された頸動脈超音波動画像に対して前処理を施し，血管壁全体の動きとプラークの動きを分離する．その後，前処理後の動画像と事前に検査者が指定したプラーク表面情報を結合し，CNNとLSTMから構成される深層ニューラルネットワークに入力する．これにより，プラーク表面の拍動性変化であるJellyfish signの特徴を考慮した識別が可能である．実験では，Jellyfish sign陽性100例，陰性100例のデータセットを用いて提案法の精度検証を行った．【結果】実験の結果，提案法は80％以上の精度でJellyfish signを識別可能であることが確認された．また，入力にプラーク表面情報を加えることで分類精度が向上することが明らかとなった．【結論】プラーク表面の情報を利用した深層学習が，Jellyfish signの自動識別において有効であることが示された．"},{"title":"Stochastic Fluctuation in EEG Evaluated via Scale Mixture Model for Decoding Emotional Valence","authors":["Shunya Fukuda","Akira Furui","Maro Machizawa","Toshio Tsuji"],"venue":"Proceedings of 2024 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2024)","venueShort":"SII","year":2024,"pages":"567-572","pdfUrl":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNDULCj1FHflD3najKaH4tWYXSMDVHbF/view?usp=sharing","codeUrl":"","doi":"10.1109/SII58957.2024.10417430","tags":["EEG","Probabilistic Model"],"type":"international","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1pnms4kRCGqJCmHZn7q0XmzxDbPnKydrL&sz=w2048","abstract":"Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis has garnered attention as a method for quantitatively decoding human emotions, and EEG amplitude values in specific frequency bands are typically used for this purpose. However, as brain states can fluctuate rapidly in response to external stimuli, accounting for temporal fluctuations in amplitude could enhance the accuracy of emotion decoding. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between pleasant/unpleasant emotions and fluctuations in EEG amplitude by utilizing a scale mixture model that assumes a hierarchical stochastic structure for EEG variance. This model focuses on the connection between the non- Gaussianity of the EEG amplitude distribution and stochastic fluctuation of the EEG variance (i.e., amplitude), which can be quantitatively evaluated by introducing a feature value. In the experiments, we used an EEG dataset obtained during the presentation of pleasant and unpleasant images and computed the proposed and conventional features, such as simple variance and approximate entropy values, for comparison. Statistical tests and receiver operating characteristic analyses of the calculated features indicated that the proposed feature, which reflects the stochastic fluctuation of variance, can distinguish between pleasant and unpleasant emotions more accurately than conventional features. These findings suggest that not only the conventional amplitude value but also its fluctuation, may be useful in assessing emotional valence."},{"title":"Epileptic seizure detection using a recurrent neural network with temporal features derived from a scale mixture EEG model","authors":["Akira Furui","Ryota Onishi","Tomoyuki Akiyama","Toshio Tsuji"],"venue":"IEEE Access","year":2024,"pages":"162814-162824","pdfUrl":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Up5QqDjI_b69VHX_th7DWfPE3IS0DIcy/view?usp=sharing","codeUrl":"","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3487637","volume":"24","number":"11","tags":["EEG","Epileptic Seizure Detection","Time-series Analysis","Probabilistic Model","Deep Learning"],"type":"journal","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1uGnZYP0ZDP6hffBQyV64QEHzeEke0eA4&sz=w2048","abstract":"Automated detection of epileptic seizures from scalp Electroencephalogram (EEG) is crucial for improving epilepsy diagnosis and management.

Specifically, the stochastic model that can consider uncertainties in the EEG amplitude is first fitted to a specific frequency band of EEG, thereby extracting relevant features of the seizure. Then, a recurrent neural network-based recognition architecture learns the temporal evolution of these features. We evaluated our method using EEG data from 20 patients with focal epilepsy, conducting comprehensive assessments including ablation studies on classifiers and features. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms static classifiers and existing feature sets, achieving high sensitivity while maintaining acceptable specificity. Furthermore, our feature set showed efficacy both independently and as a complement to existing features, indicating its robustness in seizure detection tasks.

Consequently, the narrower screen size has raised the issue of operability for text input. This problem can be resolved using external input devices, such as physical keyboards. However, this can impair portability and accessibility. This study proposes a finger-tapping motion recognition system using wrist-mounted piezoelectric film sensors to realize an input interface with high wearability and not limited by screen size. In the proposed system, biodegradable piezoelectric film sensors, which are highly compatible with biological signal measurement, are attached to the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the wrist to measure minute skin surface deformation during tapping. The system detects the occurrence of tapping movements for each finger by preprocessing the measured signals and calculating the total activity of all channels. It also recognizes the type of finger movement based on machine learning. In the experiment, we measured ten different signals, including five-finger flexion and extension, for 11 subjects, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. According to the experimental results, tapping recognition accuracy for time-series data was 77.5%, assuming character input. In addition, the time difference between the detected and actual taps was approximately 50 ms on average. Therefore, the proposed method can be utilized as an input interface for wristband-type wearable devices."},{"title":"敵対的学習に基づく患者不変特徴を利用したてんかん発作検出","authors":["田﨑 莉菜","矢沢 樹","米田 清太朗","秋山 倫之","古居 彬"],"venue":"第25回計測自動制御学会システムインテグレーション部門講演会（SI2024）","venueShort":"SI","year":2024,"month":12,"pages":"2840-2845","pdfUrl":"","tags":["EEG","Epileptic Seizure Detection","Deep Learning","Domain generalization"],"type":"domestic","coverImage":"https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1VZmhs2_Apo_ZuZD6AJoqthcnFthV9nj1&sz=w2048","abstract":"This paper proposes an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based epileptic seizure detection method using patient-invariant features.

Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited target calibration data.
