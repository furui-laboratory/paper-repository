This paper proposes an ultrasound video-based classification method for the Jellyfish sign, using deep neural networks. The proposed method first preprocesses carotid ultrasound videos to separate the movement of the vascular wall from plaque movements. Subsequently, the preprocessed videos and plaque surface information are input to a deep neural network architecture integrating convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The model assesses plaque motion by fusing the features of the plaque videos and the plaque surface information, enabling classification based on the features of the Jellyfish sign, characterized by pulsatile changes of the plaque surface. We evaluated optimal feature fusion strategies using ultrasound video images from 200 patients.
