In this paper, we propose an adaptive electromyogram (EMG) pattern classification method that integrates Bayesian sequential learning with self-training. The proposed method models EMG patterns using a scale mixture distribution framework to account for signal variance uncertainty. Leveraging this model, we estimate motion predictions and their confidence, achieving adaptive classification through Bayesian updating based on high-confidence data. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using both short- and long-term EMG datasets, demonstrating its robustness to temporal variations in EMG signals.
