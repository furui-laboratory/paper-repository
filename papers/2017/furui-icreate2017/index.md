This paper proposes a virtual restoration method of down-sampled electromyogram (EMG) signals for low-traffic wireless communication. In this approach, EMG signals measured from a wireless EMG sensor are rectified, smoothed, and transmitted with down-sampling. On the receiving side, artificial EMG signals reproducing the characteristics of the measured signals can be generated in real time based on a stochastic EMG generation model. The experiments conducted to verify restoration accuracy and applicability to measured signals indicated that the proposed method reproduces the characteristics of measured signals with high accuracy and low delay, although the amount of information transmitted is drastically reduced.
