This paper presents the estimation and analysis of surface electromyogram (EMG) signals during fatiguing contractions based on a stochastic EMG model. In the model, the probability distribution of EMG signals is assumed to be a mixture of Gaussians with the same mean but different variances, facilitating the representation of the variance distribution of EMG signals. The paper proposes a continuous estimation method for variance distribution parameters using a sliding window, enabling the evaluation of the time-varying stochastic properties of EMG signals. Estimation experiments were conducted on six healthy young adults to analyze changes in EMG variance distribution with the progression of muscle fatigue. The results reveal the linear and nonlinear relationships between muscle fatigue and variance distribution parameters.
