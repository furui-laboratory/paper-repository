This paper proposes an electromyogram (EMG) pattern classification method based on a mixture of variance distribution models. A variance distribution model is a stochastic model of raw surface EMG signals in which the EMG variance is taken as a random variable, allowing the representation of uncertainty in the variance. In this paper, we extend the variance distribution model to the multidimensional case and enhance its flexibility for multichannel and processed EMG signals. The enhanced model enables the accurate classification of EMG patterns while considering the uncertainty in the EMG variance. The robustness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated through a simulation experiment using artificially generated data and EMG classification experiments using two real datasets.
